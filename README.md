# serialportbruteforcer
Brute force a serial attached device with Windows - useful if you have a hardware device which you need to guess the password for.  

Depends on ActiveExperts Serial Port Component - https://www.activexperts.com/serial-port-component/.  This is a licensable tool, but with a free trial period.  You are welcome to fork my project and find a free replacement.  For my purposes this tool was sufficient!
